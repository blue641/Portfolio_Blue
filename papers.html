        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>Additive manufacturing (AM), more commonly referred to as 3D printing, is revolutionizing the manufacturing industry. With any new technology comes new rules and guidelines for the optimal use of said technology. Big Area Additive Manufacturing (BAAM), developed by Cincinnati Incorporated and Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Manufacturing Demonstration Facility, requires a host of new design parameters compared to small-scale 3D printing to create large-scale parts. However, BAAM also creates new possibilities in material testing and various applications in the manufacturing industry. Most of the design constraints of small-scale polymer 3D printers still apply to BAAM. Beyond those constraints, new rules and limitations exist because BAAM’s large-scale system significantly changes the thermal properties associated with small-scale AM. This work details both physical and software-related design considerations for additive manufacturing. After reading this guide, one will have a better understanding of slicing software’s capabilities and limitations, different physical characteristics of design and how to apply them appropriately for AM, and how to take the inherent nature of AM into consideration during the design process.

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>Big Area Additive Manufacturing (BAAM) is a large-scale, 3D printing technology developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Manufacturing Demonstration Facility and Cincinnati, Inc. The ability to quickly and cost-effectively manufacture unique moulds and tools is currently one of the most significant applications of BAAM. This work details the application of a BAAM system to fabricate a 10.36 m (34 ft) catamaran boat hull mould. The goal of this project was to explore the feasibility of using BAAM to directly manufacture a mould without the need for thick coatings. The mould was printed in 12 individual sections over a five-day period. After printing, the critical surfaces of the mould were CNC-machined, the sections were assembled, and a final hull was manufactured using the mould. The success of this project illustrates the time and cost savings of BAAM in the fabrication of large moulds.
